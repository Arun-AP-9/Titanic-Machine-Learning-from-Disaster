# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge for any ML enthusiast. A starting point to dive into ML competitions and familiarize with how the Kaggle platform works.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

I will be building the ML workflow with Scikit learn pipelines and test a few models. Finally, I will choose a random forest model for hyperparameter tuning and build the final ML model for predictions.

The predictions of this script ranked in top 10% of the Titanic leaderboard
